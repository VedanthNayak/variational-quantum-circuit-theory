## Abstract
This paper develops a unified variational and quantum-scattering framework for circuit theory.
Classical resistive networks are derived from a power-minimisation principle and formulated
using graph Laplacians and convex optimisation. In the quantum regime, coherent transport
is analysed using scattering theory and the Landauer–Büttiker formalism, with emphasis on
time-reversal symmetry and Onsager reciprocity.

## Motivation
This work was undertaken to explore deep structural connections between classical circuit
theory, variational principles, and quantum transport, beyond the standard high-school
curriculum.
